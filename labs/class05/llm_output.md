'll help you review the selected code in code_before.py, identify issues, and create an improved version in code_after.py. Let me first examine the current file to understand what we're working with.

Read code_before.py

Now I'll analyze this code and create an improved version. Let me identify the issues and create the code_after.py file with the improvements.

Created code_after.py

Code Review Summary
I've created code_after.py with significant improvements. Here's my analysis:

Issues Identified in Original Code:
Major Bug: The function continues iterating after finding the value, potentially overwriting the correct index with a later occurrence
Missing Type Hints: No type annotations for parameters or return value
No Documentation: Missing docstring and examples
Inefficient: Uses range(len(lst)) instead of direct iteration
Poor Variable Naming: pos is less descriptive than needed
Improvements Made:
Fixed the Core Bug:

Used lst.index(value) with exception handling for the most efficient approach
Provided a manual implementation with early return to demonstrate the fix
Added Comprehensive Type Hints:

List[Any] for the input list
Any for the search value
int for the return type
Added Detailed Documentation:

Clear docstrings with parameter descriptions
Multiple usage examples
Edge case documentation
Enhanced Functionality:

Main function uses built-in index() method (most efficient)
Alternative manual implementation for educational purposes
Bonus function find_all_indices() for finding all occurrences
Better Code Structure:

Used enumerate() for cleaner iteration
Early return pattern to avoid unnecessary iterations
Comprehensive test cases in the __main__ block
Performance Improvements:

Built-in index() method is optimized in C
Early return eliminates unnecessary iterations
Exception handling is more Pythonic than manual checks
The new implementation is more robust, efficient, and maintainable while following Python best practices.
